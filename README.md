# The ASCENT Framework for Explainable AI

This is the Github repository for the ASCENT (Ai System use Case Explanation oNTology) framework for XAI.
The ontology itself can be found in Turtle (.ttl) serialisation [here](ontology/explainability.ttl).

Paper Abstract:

> Several useful taxonomies have been published that survey the existing eXplainable AI (XAI) research field.
These taxonomies are arguably mainly useful for data scientists and AI experts because they categorize interpretability methods with respect to AI model properties.
In order to better connect the field of XAI research with concrete use cases and user needs, we designed the ASCENT (Ai System use Case Explanation oNTology) framework, which is a new ontology and corresponding metadata standard with three complementary modules for different aspects of an XAI solution: 
one for aspects of AI systems, another for use case aspects, and yet another for explanation properties of XAI techniques in the solution space.
Connecting these three aspects aids industry in finding relevant XAI solutions given the use case, whereas it helps the research community identify research gaps with respect to actual user needs.
Describing XAI solutions according to the proposed common metadata standard is an important step towards the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) usage of XAI solutions.
